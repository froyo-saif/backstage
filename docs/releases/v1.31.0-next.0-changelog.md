# Release v1.31.0-next.0

Upgrade Helper: [https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper/?to=1.31.0-next.0](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper/?to=1.31.0-next.0)

## @backstage/backend-app-api@0.10.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 19ff127: **BREAKING**: The deprecated `identityServiceFactory` and `tokenManagerServiceFactory` have been removed.
- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported. You may want to explore the new multiton patterns to achieve your goals, or moving settings to app-config.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.

### Patch Changes

- 8ba77ed: The `legacyPlugin` and `makeLegacyPlugin` helpers now provide their own shim implementation of the identity and token manager services, as these services are being removed from the new backend system.
- d425fc4: Modules, plugins, and services are now `BackendFeature`, not a function that returns a feature.
- 19ff127: Internal refactor to re-declare the token manager service which was removed from `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`, but is still supported in this package for backwards compatibility.
- 66dbf0a: Allow the cache service to accept the human duration format for TTL

  - @backstage/integration-aws-node@0.1.12

## @backstage/backend-defaults@0.5.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 359fcd7: **BREAKING**: The backwards compatibility with plugins using legacy auth through the token manager service has been removed. This means that instead of falling back to using the old token manager, requests towards plugins that don't support the new auth system will simply fail. Please make sure that all plugins in your deployment are hosted within a backend instance from the new backend system.

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.

- 19ff127: **BREAKING**: The default backend instance no longer provides implementations for the identity and token manager services, which have been removed from `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`.

  If you rely on plugins that still require these services, you can add them to your own backend by re-creating the service reference and factory.

  The following can be used to implement the identity service:

  ```ts
  import {
    coreServices,
    createServiceFactory,
    createServiceRef,
  } from '@backstage/backend-plugin-api';
  import {
    DefaultIdentityClient,
    IdentityApi,
  } from '@backstage/plugin-auth-node';

  backend.add(
    createServiceFactory({
      service: createServiceRef<IdentityApi>({ id: 'core.identity' }),
      deps: {
        discovery: coreServices.discovery,
      },
      async factory({ discovery }) {
        return DefaultIdentityClient.create({ discovery });
      },
    }),
  );
  ```

  The following can be used to implement the token manager service:

  ```ts
  import { ServerTokenManager, TokenManager } from '@backstage/backend-common';
  import { createBackend } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';
  import {
    coreServices,
    createServiceFactory,
    createServiceRef,
  } from '@backstage/backend-plugin-api';

  backend.add(
    createServiceFactory({
      service: createServiceRef<TokenManager>({ id: 'core.tokenManager' }),
      deps: {
        config: coreServices.rootConfig,
        logger: coreServices.rootLogger,
      },
      createRootContext({ config, logger }) {
        return ServerTokenManager.fromConfig(config, {
          logger,
          allowDisabledTokenManager: true,
        });
      },
      async factory(_deps, tokenManager) {
        return tokenManager;
      },
    }),
  );
  ```

- f687050: Removed the following deprecated exports

  - `BackendPluginConfig` use `CreateBackendPluginOptions`
  - `BackendModuleConfig` use `CreateBackendModuleOptions`
  - `ExtensionPointConfig` use `CreateExtensionPointOptions`

- 4d82481: Removed deprecated `ServiceFactoryOrFunction` type.

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them.

## @backstage/frontend-app-api@0.9.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 62cce6c: Removed deprecated `icons` property passing to `createApp` and `createSpecializedApp`. Use `IconBundleBlueprint.make` to create extensions instead and include them in the app.

### Patch Changes

- f3a2b91: Moved several implementations of built-in APIs from being hardcoded in the app to instead be provided as API extensions. This moves all API-related inputs from the `app` extension to the respective API extensions. For example, extensions created with `ThemeBlueprint` are now attached to the `themes` input of `api:app-theme` rather than the `app` extension.
- 5446061: Internal refactor following removal of v1 extension support. The app implementation itself still supports v1 extensions at runtime.
- 4a66456: Added the `root` extension the replace the `app` extension as the root of the app.

## @backstage/frontend-plugin-api@0.8.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 5446061: **BREAKING**: Removed support for "v1" extensions. This means that it is no longer possible to declare inputs and outputs as objects when using `createExtension`. In addition, all extension creators except for `createComponentExtension` have been removed, use the equivalent blueprint instead. See the [1.30 migration documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/frontend-system/architecture/migrations/#130) for more information on this change.

For example, extensions created with `ThemeBlueprint` are now attached to the `themes` input of `api:app-theme` rather than the `app` extension.
- 4a66456: A new `apis` parameter has been added to `factory` for extensions. This is a way to access utility APIs without being coupled to the React context.

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported. You may want to explore the new multiton patterns to achieve your goals, or moving settings to app-config.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.

### Patch Changes

## @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-scaffolder-entity-model@0.2.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported.

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported. You may want to explore the new multiton patterns to achieve your goals, or moving settings to app-config.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.
